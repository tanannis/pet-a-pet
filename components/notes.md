## Animated.Value 

interpolate(): is a method that is available to be called on any Animated.Value, and it interpolates the value of the coordinate, before updating the UI properly

inputRange: is a length of the area that the animation can reach: moving to the left, center/initial value, moving to the right

outputRange: is the degree of the card will drop: to left, center/initial value, to right

extrapolate: is used to prevent the output value from exceeding outputRange
