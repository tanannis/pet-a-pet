## Install and Setup

- npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack

* Next, install the required peer dependencies. You need to run different commands depending on whether your project is an Expo managed project or a bare React Native project.

If you have an Expo managed project, install the dependencies with expo:

- expo install react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context @react-native-community/masked-view

* If you have a bare React Native project, install the dependencies with npm:

- npm install react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context @react-native-community/masked-view
